Concern

I attempted to debug the error without success. Each time the application initializes on a new device and a new user profile is created, the 'Add to Cart' functionality exhibits erratic behavior. However, once the user profile is logged out and subsequently either re-logged in or a new account is established on the same device, the function stabilizes and operates correctly. This issue appears to be related to caching mechanisms within the application.
